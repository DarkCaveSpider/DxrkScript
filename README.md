# DxrkConsole Documentation
DxrkConsole is a WIP Utility script built for Synapse X with built-in functions.


## Run code Via console
To run any line of code in DxrkConsole, simply input it into the **Console Window**.


## Core Functions
DxrkConsole comes packed with many built-in functions to run easily as if they were any other lua function.
Here are the current core functions / utilities which you can run at any time and use in DxrkConsole

### _infyield()
This command executes the <sub>Infinite Yield Utility GUI</sub> (Admin Commands,) one of the most useful functions.

### _printc(str,typ)
Prints a string (str) to DxrkConsole. typ will change
how the string is displayed in console. use "**def**," "**wrn**," or "**err**" for default, warning, and error respectively.
Alternatively, you can also give no second argument, which will continue the string on the current line with no formatting. This can be used to recolor the console window! Refer to the [chart](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64674644/169839016-5995ebb3-9810-48c1-a404-5ffb001a634f.png);
A first argument is nessecary.

### _clrc(bool)
Clears the console! Set (Bool) to true to have the [startup menu]
